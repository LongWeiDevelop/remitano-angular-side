  p
    ' Thank you for using Remitano service for trading bitcoin. Before you proceed,
    ' please take the following points into account:
  p
    ol
      li A trade in Remitano is an exchange between the maker (who makes an advertisement) and the taker (who responses to that advertisement). Regardless of their role as buyer or seller, the taker will be charged 1% of that trade (fee included in the displayed price).
      li The price is determined by the maker without any influence from Remitano. Vice versa, the maker is fully responsible for the posted price. As a consequence, we will not cancel any advertisement that has been taken due to reasons of mistaken price or unwillingness to proceed from taker, we also wonâ€™t provide the contact information, supporter can reopen the trade to disputed and ask traders to deal together. And that disputed trade should be closed within 2 hours.

Any proof of scamming, spaming or deliberate tricking will result in banned account forever without giving a clear reason and quarantined remaining balance.

It is for our best interest to protect the right user, however you are responsible first and for most to be a cautious and clever trader.
