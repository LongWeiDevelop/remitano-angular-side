  p
    ' By using this Site, and further by registering to use our Service, you ("You, Your or Yourself") are agreeing
    ' to accept and comply with the terms and conditions of use stated below ("Terms of Use"). You should read the entire
    ' Terms of Use carefully before you use this web site ("Site") or any of the services of this Site. As used herein,
    ' "Remitano" refers to the company Remitano Co. Ltd., including without limitation thereby, its owners,
    ' directors, investors, employees or other related parties. Depending upon context, "Remitano" may also refer
    ' to the services, products, Site, content or other materials (collectively, "Materials") provided by Remitano.
    ' The Service operated by Remitano allows buyers ("Buyers") and sellers ("Sellers"), to buy and sell the Internet
    ' currency known as "Bitcoins" (see <a href="http://bitcoin.org" target="_blank">http://bitcoin.org</a>).
  p The Service operated by Remitano also allows all registered users of the Service ("Members") to:
  ul
    li Transfer Bitcoins to you or other Members or other users of Bitcoin outside the Remitano site.
    li Use Bitcoins for purchasing goods.
  p
    ' Depending on Your country of residence, You may not be able to use all the functions of the Site. It is your responsibility
    ' to follow those rules and laws in Your country of residence and/or country from which You access this Site and Services.
    ' As long as you agree to and actually comply with these Terms of Use, Remitano grants to you a personal,
    ' non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable and limited right to enter and use the Site and the Service.
  p
    ' IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THE TERMS OF USE AND CONDITIONS OUTLINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT ACCESS THIS SITE AND DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE.
  p By opening an account to use the Service ("Account"), You expressly represent and warrant:
  p

  h4 RISKS
  p
    ' The trading of goods and products, real or virtual, as well as virtual currencies involves significant risk. Prices can and do
    ' fluctuate on any given day. Due to such price fluctuations, you may increase or lose value in your assets at any given moment.
    ' Any currency - virtual or not - may be subject to large swings in value and may even become worthless. There is an inherent risk
    ' that losses will occur as a result of buying, selling or trading anything on a market.
  p
    ' Bitcoin trading also has special risks not generally shared with official currencies or goods or commodities in a market.
    ' Unlike most currencies, which are backed by governments or other legal entities, or by commodities such as gold or silver,
    ' Bitcoin is a unique kind of "fiat" currency, backed by technology and trust. There is no central bank that can take corrective
    ' measure to protect the value of Bitcoins in a crisis or issue more currency.
  p
    ' Instead, Bitcoin is an as-yet autonomous and largely unregulated worldwide system of currency firms and individuals.
    ' Traders put their trust in a digital, decentralized and partially anonymous system that relies on peer-to-peer networking and
    ' cryptography to maintain its integrity.
  p
    ' Bitcoin trading is probably susceptible to irrational (or rational) bubbles or loss of confidence, which could collapse demand
    ' relative to supply. For example, confidence might collapse in Bitcoin because of unexpected changes imposed by the software developers
    ' or others, a government crackdown, the creation of superior competing alternative currencies, or a deflationary or inflationary spiral.
    ' Confidence might also collapse because of technical problems: if the anonymity of the system is compromised, if money is lost or stolen,
    ' or if hackers or governments are able to prevent any transactions from settling.
  p There may be additional risks that we have not foreseen or identified in our Terms of Use.
  p
    ' You should carefully assess whether your financial situation and tolerance for risk is suitable for buying, selling or trading Bitcoins.
  p
    ' We use our banking providers in order to receive client moneys and making payments. Our banking providers DO NOT transfer
    ' Bitcoins, exchange Bitcoins, or provide any services in connection with Bitcoins.
